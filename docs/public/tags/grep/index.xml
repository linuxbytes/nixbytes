          A great way to update docker images is to use this one-liner. Since, docker does not have a command; this command will update images that you have already pulled. The only way is to pull all images again using docker pull command. This simple one-liner can help you update all images at once.
docker images |grep -v REPOSITORY|awk &#39;{print $1}&#39;|xargs -L1 docker pull

          Graphical tree of sub-directories This oneliner command is for a graphical tree of sub-directories, this is an excellent oneliner when you&amp;rsquo;re in need to view the directories in a graphical format. The tree is a recursive directory listing command or program that produces a depth indented listing of files which not generally found on all Linux or Unix systems. The first Tree Unix utility was developed by Steve Baker which includes a verbose of feature and flag option.
