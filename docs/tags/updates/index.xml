          Writing Back # New Year to start exploring new tech and focus on a few things. AI, Machine learning, cyber security, Lower level programming languages, to name a few.Hope I will wonder what the future will bring in these trying times. The next focus or project is to write more rust programming language and a little blog or community surrounding it. The command line world and its related tools. This is a footnote for myself, and see what I can document as I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good memory, so tech will help me in that area.
