I am a Linux engineer by day and a coder by night. I am an ambitious problem solver with a passion for  Linux (Slackware, Redhat, Ubuntu, Centos)/Unix (Solaris, AIX, OSX), development, coding and technology as a whole. 
I am continually evaluating and upgrading my skills so that I can stay at the cutting edge of IT by studying and taking online courses. I started to create this blog to share my passion with technology. 

### Technology 

#### Linux and Unix Systems

I Have worked with various Unix and Linux systems, love the platform, and philosophy on how this technology has done and involved over the years. Primary Linux Distro includes Redhat, Centos, Ubuntu, Debian, and experimented with various others.

#### Code

Love to code on my spare time, its a great way to keep the mind busy.


#### Web Technology

The web has given us so much. I believe it should still be open and freeâ€”that why we need to help opensource projects to ensure its freedom and assessability for all
