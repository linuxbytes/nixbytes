# The garbage collector

Since early programming, many languages have used the known garbage collector to manage memory resources. Now, the variation of garbage collection has improved or helped programmers to focus on other tasks like feature requests or bug fixes. A newer language called rust uses a different approach called borrowing and ownership. Each part of your program needs to be aware of and manage these resources, or the wizard complier Gandalf will cast you shall not pass.
