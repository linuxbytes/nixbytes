          A great way to update docker images is to use this one-liner. Since, docker does not have a command; this command will update images that you have already pulled. The only way is to pull all images again using docker pull command. This simple one-liner can help you update all images at once.
docker images |grep -v REPOSITORY|awk &amp;#39;{print $1}&amp;#39;|xargs -L1 docker pull

          AWS Cloud # The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful and convenient tool that allows you to manage and control your AWS services with ease. By using a unified interface, you no longer need to switch between multiple tools or dashboards to manage your cloud infrastructure. Instead, you can control all your AWS services from the command line, which provides a streamlined and efficient approach to managing your cloud environment.
