          Embracing BSD: A Journey Through Linux Distros to FreeBSD # Introduction # In the world of operating systems, finding the right fit is akin to a personal quest. My journey through various Linux distributions led me to FreeBSD, a choice that aligns perfectly with my needs. Let me take you through my experiences with different Linux distros and why ultimately, BSD made the most sense for me.
Starting with Slackware: Laying the Foundation # Slackware was my initiation into the world of Linux.

Today, we delve into the mystical world of Vim, where keystrokes become spells, and code transforms at our whim. Join me as we explore a spellbinding Vim script, an incantation designed to transmute chaotic C code into a tapestry of elegance and order.

          The symbols and incantations that make up the assembly-like code. Interestingly, this language for the CPU is closer to the machine code that a computer can understand, providing greater control over the hardware. Reading and writing are more challenging than high-level programming languages like Javascript or Python. The main is using a basic concept of hello world and memory stack. With Today&amp;rsquo;s AI, Cloud, and other buzz words technology stack, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to come back to the roots sometimes and see how things work on a simple level

The next focus or project is to write more rust programming language and a little blog or community surrounding it. The command line world and its related tools. This is a footnote for myself, and see what I can document as I don&amp;rsquo;t have a good memory, so tech will help me in that area.

Some argue scripting is false and compiling machine code is best, but not too low or high is the battle for many developers, engineers, and coders. This paradigm is better than others etc. If you can type it and run it, it is programming as long it turns complete.

          Given an integer number, find the most frequent digit in it.
how to count things efficiently?
keep calm and code in Python!
Let use the statistics that comes with python stand library
Statistic Module # This module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric (Real-valued) data.
import statistics from statistics import mode This module statistics offers a Single mode (most common value) of discrete or nominal data. The values or method to find this is to convert the vaules into a string and then back again once the frequent digit is found

          A great way to update docker images is to use this one-liner. Since, docker does not have a command; this command will update images that you have already pulled. The only way is to pull all images again using docker pull command. This simple one-liner can help you update all images at once.
docker images |grep -v REPOSITORY|awk &amp;#39;{print $1}&amp;#39;|xargs -L1 docker pull

So far, the language is not as scary as many make it be. Let touch on a few things on why C++ is good to learn.
First The Community # The language itself has many followers, and many business use C++ for varies of reason.

          In the world of shell piping, there&amp;rsquo;s a powerful technique that involves piping the standard output (stdout) of one command into the standard input (stdin) of another. However, what happens when you need to pipe the output of multiple commands? This is where process substitution comes in handy.
Process substitution is a shell technique that allows you to use the output of a command as a file argument to another command, without the need to create temporary files or named pipes.

It also The bash was first released in 1989 and was created for the GNU project as a replacement for their Bourne shell. It is capable of performing functions such as interactive command line editing, and job control on architectures that support it

          Regex&amp;rsquo;s some hate some love, but in the end, we all need something productive in our life. Some people hate because the mini-language can be arcane. Others love it because it adds superpowers for text processing. Learning the arcane secrets of regex can be a rough experience, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to.
so let do some exercises on regex like emails and IP for your everyday technical needs

With iSH Shell is a Linux shell for iOS that uses an x86 emulator to run a simplified version of Alpine Linux on IOS. You can install packages and additional software directly into iSH with the Alpine package manager.
Why Alpine Linux you say?

Perhaps a few regexes (regular expressions) is fine for simple tasks, but for complex problems, having a deeper knowledge on many levels can boost your technical skill to a new level especially with the need for big data.

          The cat is known for reading files sequentially and display its output. it maybe be a simple command line tool, but it has many uses. cat is know a known tool throght the unix history and has been port over into GNU coreutils. One important factor about cat is that since because it does not require the files to consist of lines of text, but works with any sort of data.

This site is for anyone who enjoys working and using the command line aka shell. Soon we are going to add tutorials, talks, news, and man others thing about the command line for any who lives or loves using the command line. Gui is a great interface, but as we know the command line offers more precision and power than any other interface known to humans as this current state.

          Hello, This is my first Post for discussing technology, and its uses started to blog to speak about the passion I have for Linux/Unix, Python and Open Source technology. I will Post my thought with no scheduled time frame, and I am thinking of adding a new post on my twitter account if you wish to follow me feel free to do so. Hope you enjoy my blog post and my thought on tech.
